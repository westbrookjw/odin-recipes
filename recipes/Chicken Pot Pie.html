        <li>Preheat the oven to 400F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Mix together 
            until combined. Add the milk, egg and butter and mix until combined.</li><li>Working quickly, scoop 8 
            large spoonfuls of the batter onto the baking sheet. Using wet fingers, gently smooth/form the top of 
            scoop into a biscuit shape. Whisk together the egg wash then brush the top of each biscuit with the 
            wash.</li><li>Bake for 10 minutes until set. Remove from the oven and set aside until the filling is 
            ready. (You’ll finish baking them with the filling.)</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Make The Filling</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot or dutch oven over medium heat (the pot you choose is the one you’ll be 
            baking your pot pie in, make sure it’s big enough!).</li><li>Add the chopped onion and cook until 
            softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li><li>Sprinkle the gluten-free flour over the onion mixture and 
            whisk until smooth. Stir in the salt, pepper, and paprika, mustard, and thyme until well-combined.
        </li><li>Gradually stir in the chicken stock and heavy cream. Add the potatoes and carrots, and bring 
            the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently until the liquid has thickened and the 
            potatoes and carrots are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes. Stir in the frozen 
            vegetables and cook for another 5-10 minutes until tender.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Bake The Pie</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the shredded chicken. Top the gluten-free pot pie with the pre-baked 
            biscuits, bake for 20-25 minutes or until biscuits are beginning to turn a light golden brown and are 
            cooked through. Serve and enjoy!</li>
